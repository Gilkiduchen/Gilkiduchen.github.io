I'm an undergraduate student majoring in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), expected to graduate in June 2026. My research interests include semiconductor device physics, VLSI design, stereo matching algorithms, machine learning applications, and embedded systems.

I have gained valuable research experience through internships at prestigious institutions:
- **[Institute of Microelectronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.ime.cas.cn/)** (Beijing, China), focusing on time-dependent dielectric breakdown mechanisms in semiconductors.
- **[Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.sim.cas.cn/)** (Shanghai, China), researching optimization of stereo matching algorithms using Large Language Models (LLMs).
- **[National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/)** (Online), contributing to digital twin initiatives to enhance wastewater treatment efficiency prediction using machine learning.

I have also conducted previous research at the **[Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.iue.cas.cn/)** and **[Xiamen University](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/)**, resulting in publications on microbial fuel cells and wastewater treatment techniques:
- [Effects of Different Fertilizers on Electricity Production of Rice - Microbial Fuel Cells](https://www.cnki.net/KCMS/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CJFD&dbname=CJFDLAST2019&filename=YNHK201905001&uniplatform=OVERSEA&v=qhJ5ffo3HXe9I5Xnw8WcyczhQIcByxLmxt2SGaXddNuVpoEphvJ2DvNfV-zjJsb7), *Environmental Science Guide*, 2019 (in Chinese).
- [Effect of the ultraviolet/chlorine process on microbial community structure, typical pathogens, and antibiotic resistance genes in reclaimed water](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11783-022-1521-z), *Frontiers of Environmental Science & Engineering*, 2022.
